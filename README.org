* wrong information in zotero
https://www.zotero.org/groups/1051264/seshat_databank/items/JLUQ2Z9P
The date is 1078 but book was written in 1992 I think.


* improvement ideas:
** TODO remove first name matches for authors and/or add matches of initials for authors
** TODO add 2 word chunk matching to title instead/additionally to BOW method

** TODO create validation data set
Lets see how good our method perform maybe we can even do hyperparameter optimization
